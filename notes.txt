how about the firmware stuff? is that in here too? what about how we send out i2c? what if I want to use a different type of relay volume setup? I think that what I want to use works slightly differently than what the mcu is currently mean to send out. 

it uses the same i2c io expander, but the actual pattern per volume level mgiht be different

okay yea

there are because it uses latching relays

iirc it's still basically a binary number, but I guess I just send out port a?

check out the relaxid passive txt file

it uses gpb0 - gpb5 for the volume

these are non latching relays, so we need to just keep them pinned on 

I'm realizing tha tmaybe latching isn't such a bad idea for next time

but you get the picture

we only have 6 bits (less volume steps)

still basically binary though, but 6 bit binary volume

I dont know if 0 or 5 is the msb, I guess we'll just have to try both
